The `formData` state variable in the frontend holds all the data needed to create a new post. When the form is submitted, the data from `formData` is sent to the backend using the `createPost` function. This function makes a POST request to the backend, which then processes the data and adds the new post to the database.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how this works with your existing backend logic:

### Frontend: `CreatePosts.js`

When the user submits the form, the `handleSubmit` function is called. This function gathers all the data from `formData` and sends it to the backend via the `createPost` function.

### Frontend: `PostsManager.js`

The `createPost` function makes a POST request to the backend with the post data.

### Backend: Handling the POST Request

The backend logic for handling the POST request is already in place. It reads the incoming data, processes it, and inserts a new post into the database.

### Integration

1. **Form Submission (Frontend):**
   - When the form is submitted, the `handleSubmit` function gathers all form data from the `formData` state and calls `createPost` with this data.

2. **POST Request (Frontend):**
   - The `createPost` function in `PostsManager.js` sends the data to the backend using a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/posts`.

3. **Request Handling (Backend):**
   - The backend receives the POST request and the `create_post` function processes the data, inserting a new post into the database.

4. **Response (Backend):**
   - The backend sends a response back to the frontend with the details of the newly created post.

This flow ensures that the data managed in the `formData` state on the frontend is correctly sent to and processed by the backend, allowing new posts to be created in the database.
